I decided to put the item numbers between 5 and 50 as that is a pretty reasonable amount for my family.
It was interesting to see that when I added more checkers, the wait time and idle time went up, but there was no one in the wait line.
Although when I adjusted the checkers to one, there were 27 waiting and the wait time went up but the idle time went down.
So adding more checkers seemed to increase the idle time but the wait time seemed to fluctuate.
